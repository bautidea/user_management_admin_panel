# User management administrator panel.

This projects consist in an administrator panel where users user information is displayed, to develop this app i've used the API provided by <a href='https://randomuser.me/'>Random User Generator</a>.

This project is part of an online technical assessment i've taken in order, to improve my front-end dev skills, the steps followed for developing this:

<ol>
<li>Fetch 100 rows of data from API, and display it in a table format.</li>
</ol>
